# QRcode_item_adder-ResTful-API

This is just a proof of concept android application made where the QR code scanner in my android application is able to scan a QR code on a certain item in a warehouse and insert the details of the item into a JSON API instead of  a SQL database.

Hence, a simple ResTful API was made using node.js, node-restful library and MongoDB available on Github. The node.js is all written in an Ubuntu cloud server. To see the JSON API, you will have to go in to the URL:http://35.237.163.36:60001/product. As of now I am not running the node.js script, so you wouldnt be able to see anything.
