# QRcode_item_adder-ResTful-API

This is just a proof of concept application made where the QR code scanner in my android application is able to scan a QR code on a certain item in a warehouse and insert the details of the item into a JSON API instead of  SQL database.

Hence, a simple ResTful API was made using node.js, node-restful library and MongoDB available on Github.
